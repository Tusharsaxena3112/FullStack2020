      I started design small web pages in the 2nd year of Btech.I took me a lot of extra efforts while learning CSS. Then I switched to React.js as the beauty of React is just you can design websites a lot more easily and fast. React.js uses components policy ie, you can make different part of the website in the form of components which you can use in most of your projects.
